# Bootcamp_Projects


These are the projects that I made on my own during Dr. Angela Yu's Bootcamp Course. The pictures and some of the CSS files have been provided by the instructor. I have added my modifications to the projects too.

Some of the projects have been hosted on Heroku and the links are in this readme file.

#### Blog Website
>A simple blogsite that is made by using Node, Express and MongoDB.

#### Dice Challenge
> A very simple Dice game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

#### Drum Set Challenge
> A Drum Set made using event listeners in JavaScript, HTML and CSS to enjoy drumming virtually.
#### Newsletter Sign Up
> A sign up page for Newletter made using Node, Express and MailChimp API. You can check it out [here](https://secure-fortress-54203.herokuapp.com/).
#### Potter API
> This API was made using Node and Express. Postman came as a great help when I wanted to test my requests. I have named it Potter API because I have saved articles related to the wizarding world in my database but this API can be used for literally anything.

#### HP Simon Game

> Yet another project to show my love for Harry Potter. This project is an online version of the famous pattern remembering Simon Game which I have made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and modified by replacing the buttons by Hogwartz Houses.It has been hosted using Github Pages. You can play the game [here](https://anadimandloi.github.io/) using a desktop.

#### To-Do List
>I made this project using Node, Express and MongoDB and deployed it using Heroku. I have made some changes to the design and kept it smart. You can check it out [here](https://limitless-shelf-31036.herokuapp.com/).
